This repository introduces the implementation of the Successiive Closed Forms (SCF) algorithms used in [SDR-Based Hardware Implementation and Performance Measurement of Transmit Beampattern Design Algorithms
]([https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9266553](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9266553)). The SCF algorithm was firstly presented in [Tractable MIMO beampattern design under constant modulus waveform constraint
](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7485317/similar#similar).
