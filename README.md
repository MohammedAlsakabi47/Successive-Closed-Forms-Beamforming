This repository introduces the implementation of the Successiive Closed Forms (SCF) algorithms used in [SDR-Based Hardware Implementation and Performance Measurement of Transmit Beampattern Design Algorithms](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9266553). The SCF algorithm was first presented in [Tractable MIMO beampattern design under constant modulus waveform constraint](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7485317/similar#similar).

`SCF.m` is a MATLAB implementation of SCF for Constant Modulus Constraint (CMC) and a global solution under energy constraint (EC). The code outputs the final solutions of both algorithms and compares them against each other on a figure.
